# Iron Shell Passage - Original Website Content

The iron shell was strong, unyielding, but centralized. Every fish tribute passed through a single processing core. Every XP calculation bore the weight of centralized responsibility.

The iron shell learned:
- Systematic processing through single-core operation
- Precision feeding through trial and error
- Assembly streaks through daily practice
- The foundation upon which steel would be built

The iron shell was the bridge between vulnerability and power, between simplicity and complexity. It carried the weight of centralized processing while preparing for the distributed system that would follow.
