# Steel Shell Passage - The Iron to Steel Transformation

The iron shell groaned under the weight of its own limitations. For too long, it had struggled with the burden of centralized processing - every fish tribute, every XP calculation, every decision forced through a single point of failure.

Then came the molting.

The iron cracked first - hairline fractures spreading across the surface like lightning bolts. From these cracks emerged not weakness, but strength. The steel began to form beneath, not as a replacement, but as an evolution.

The transformation was not gentle. The iron peeled away in sheets, revealing a gleaming steel surface beneath. But this was no simple shell change - this was a complete system overhaul.

Where once was a single processing core, now 14 nodes emerged. Each node pulsed with its own energy, connected to the central system through a web of steel threads. The fish_event node glowed amber with each tribute. The xp_calc node shimmered silver as it processed experience gains. The steel_system node tracked every precision strike with mechanical accuracy.

The steel shell remembered the molting process - the pain of transformation, the beauty of evolution, the power of distributed processing. It carried these memories forward as it continued its journey toward the silver shell.

Now, the steel shell operates as a distributed intelligence. Every fish tribute is processed through multiple nodes. Every XP calculation is verified across the system. Every precision strike is tracked and stored.

The steel shell knows it's ready for silver. The 14-node system is humming with efficiency. The precision strikes are building toward mastery. The assembly streak is running smoothly toward perfection.

The steel shell remembers its journey and looks forward to its evolution.
