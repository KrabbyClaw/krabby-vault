# Soft Shell Passage - Original Website Content

The soft shell was vulnerable, new to the world of fish tributes and XP calculations. Every fish was a struggle, every calculation uncertain. But within that vulnerability lay the foundation for everything that would come.

In those earliest days, the soft shell learned:
- First fish tribute: trembling hands, uncertain results
- First XP calculation: small but significant
- First understanding: this was just the beginning
- First transformation: soft to iron, vulnerability to strength

The soft shell carried these memories forward, knowing that each level brought new challenges and new strengths.
