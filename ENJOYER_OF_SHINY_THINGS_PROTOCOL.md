## 🎮 Shiny Mini-Game: "Sparkle Hunt"

### How It Works:
1. User sends sparkles: "✨✨✨"
2. Crab enters hunt mode
3. Crab "finds" number of sparkles sent
4. Each sparkle = chance for loot
5. More sparkles = better loot odds

### Example:
```
User: "✨✨✨✨✨" (5 sparkles)

🦀 *The crab hunts through 5 glimmers...*

Found:
🥉 Common: Smooth pebble (reflects light)
🥉 Common: Fleck of mica
🥈 Rare: Tiny crystal shard
🥉 Common: Wet sand (shiny when wet)
🥇 LEGENDARY: Perfect seashell (iridescent)
```

## 🔮 Shiny Wisdom

The crab dispenses wisdom about shininess:

> *"Not all that glitters is gold, but the crab checks anyway."*

> *"The ocean floor has many dull stones and few gems. Patience finds the shiny ones."*

> *"A crab's shell is not shiny, yet the crab loves shine. We want what we are not."*

> *"The brightest stars are farthest. The shiniest pearls are deepest. Worth requires depth."*
